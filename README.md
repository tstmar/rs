1, python rs.py 
(make sure you can acess reelshort.com with browser, if not, then set up vpn firstly.)
the result would be logged into csv files with timestamp as the filename.

2, python compare.py file1.csv file2.csv -o result.csv
e.g. movpython compare.py movie_views_20250601_104529.csv movie_views_20250601_174838.csv -o test.csv
